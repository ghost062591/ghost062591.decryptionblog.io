# My Astrophotography Beginning. 

Astrophotography, at it's core, is a niche of photography that focuses on everything astronomy. From atmospheric events such as Aurora Borealis *aka the Northern Lights* to Deep Sky Objects or **DSO's**. Gear can range from your smartphone all the way up to building an observatory on the top of a mountain in Chile. 

I started my astrophotography journey back in September 2021 when I purchased my first computerized telescope. A Celestron NextStar 130SLT

I remember trying to use a telescope that lived at my grandparents house. I was amazed by what I saw: nothing. I was a little kid that knew nothing about telescopes. I probably never even tried to focus it. Just because I never got it to work properly, doesn't mean I wasn't hooked to the idea of seeing what's out there is the endless void of space. Anyway, back to the NextStar.

I took the gear out to an empty lot near my house, set, it up, and started looking through it. I was amazed when I was able to get Jupiter in my crosshairs. It was so fuzzy, but I could see the iconic layers of it's clouds. I held my phone to the eyepiece to snap a picture.

Then I slewed (term used that means to m) over to Saturn to see what I could see. Still fuzzy, I was able to see the beautiful rings. I remember trying to snap a photo but, with no success. I was more interested in being in the moment.
